# Start server:

For local server i am using Parcel.js. Just type this to the console:

```

```

# File destripction:

index.js = main file with the game loop  
game.js = file with the game class where we put everything together  

ball.js = file with ball.  
brick.js = file with bricks.  
paddle.js = file with paddle.  
lives.js = file with lives  

input.js = file that is checking the input.  
showLife.js = simpel function that shows lives :D  
random.js = functions for generating random position.  
collsionDetection.js = file with the collison detection  
levels.js = function that creates levels.  


# My problem:
If you will watch for a few seconds a ball, you will see that it is little bit buggy. The ball sometimes jump to the brick.
